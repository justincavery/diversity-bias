## Virgin Media Careers

## Sainsburys

\- Need to bill the Google API stuff

\- Justin to speak to Chris on the Friday about the tech pages coming together

\- These tech pages need to be sorted by September

\- GTM codes need to have techmark added to them

\- Danny to follow up to see if the Sainsburyâ€™s reporting is suitable and a chargable thing

## Nuffield Health

\- Migration is complete

\- Dan has hidden the job alerts page and the navigation.

\- Lucy Dickson is going to recreate that capability in WorkDay and then send through the updated link. No timeframe is set on this yet.

## Aldi

\- Tender is being done

\- Justin is writing the Website work and it will be submitted on Friday.

\- Pitch should be sometime after Justin is back in the business, but quite a bit of work would be needed to turn it into a pitch (I think)
