  title: Hello Diversity
  component: features_block.html
  subtitle: An inclusive environment gets better engagement, better retention and
    even helps achieve higher financial profits. Yet many employers still use language
    like ‘coding ninja’ or ‘sales rockstar’ in copy – turning key talent off. Our
    next generation inclusion tool can help you communicate in a way that’s more welcoming.

  - title: Gender Bias
    content: The tools on the market today typically use an outdated binary list of
      ‘male’ and ’female’ words. Our enhanced data set uses linguistic context to
      report on gender in a more nuanced way. This tool automatically generates alerts
      on gender bias in your website and job copy, providing alternative, more neutral
      terms. It can also create reports to track your trends and progress over time.

  - title: Recruiter Jargon
    content: Table tennis? Friday beers? Studies show that candidates are not persuaded
      by ‘empty benefits’ like these. Our tool scans for and reports on these too,
      supporting you to create more meaningful reasons to join.

  - title: Beyond Gender
    content: Gender bias is only one type of exclusion that can appear in your copy.
      Our tool uses a much broader set of data that allows you to consider other dimensions
      of diversity, such as BAME and socio-economic background – using the same easy,
      automated process.
